        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol><li>Peel and matchstick the garlic and ginger. Whack the lemongrass against your work surface, remove the tough outer layer, then finely slice.</li><li>Lay out a large sheet of greaseproof paper. Place the chicken breasts on one half, then stab a few times with the knife – this will help the flavour to penetrate. Sprinkle with a small pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the garlic, ginger and lemongrass, and drizzle with a little olive oil. Fold the paper over and bash with a rolling pin to flatten to 1.5cm thick.</li><li>Prepare the noodles</li><li>Put a 30cm non-stick frying pan on a high heat and, once hot, place the chicken in the pan, lemongrass side down. Cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through. When you turn it, tip in the mixed veg alongside to cook through.</li><li>Drain the noodles and divide between your plates. Move the chicken to a board. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of teriyaki over each plate of noodles and the chicken, also drizzling with a little extra virgin olive oil, if you like.</li><li>Toss 1 tablespoon of teriyaki and the juice of 1 lime with the veg in the pan for a final 30 seconds, then pile over the noodles. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.</li></ol>
